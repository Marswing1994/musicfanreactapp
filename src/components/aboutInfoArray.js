      title: 'Childhood and Family',
      content: 'Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O’Connell was born on December 18, 2001, in Los Angeles, California. She is the daughter of Maggie Baird, an actress and teacher, and Patrick O’Connell, an actor. Both of her parents are also musicians and contribute to Eilish’s tours. She is of Irish and Scottish descent and was conceived through in vitro fertilization. \n\n Her middle name, Eilish, was initially intended to be her first name, while Pirate was chosen as her middle name. However, after her grandfather, William Baird, passed away while her mother was pregnant, her parents decided to name her Billie in his honor. \n\n Eilish grew up in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. She and her older brother, Finneas, were homeschooled by their mother, Maggie Baird, a decision their parents made to spend more time with them and allow them the freedom to pursue their interests. Baird taught both children the basics of songwriting, and Eilish credits her mother and brother for inspiring her to pursue music. Their parents encouraged them to express themselves creatively and explore various activities, including art, dancing, and acting. \n\n Eilish began performing at talent shows and joined the Los Angeles Children’s Chorus at the age of eight. She started playing the ukulele when she was six years old. At age 11, she wrote her first “real” song during her mother’s songwriting class. The song, inspired by the television series "The Walking Dead", was about a zombie apocalypse and included lines and titles from the show’s scripts. \n\n Although she tried acting auditions, which she did not enjoy, Eilish found pleasure in recording background dialogue for crowd scenes in films such as "Diary of a Wimpy Kid", "Ramona and Beezus", and the "X-Men" series. She also took dance classes but had to stop in 2016 after a growth plate injury ended her dance career. Following this setback, Eilish shifted her focus entirely to recording music.'

      title: 'Musical Beginnings',
      content: 'In 2015, at just 13 years old, Billie Eilish began collaborating with her brother Finneas, who had experience writing and producing music with his band. Together, they recorded their first songs, "She`s Broken" and "Fingers Crossed," and uploaded them to SoundCloud for fun. On November 18, 2015, they released "Ocean Eyes," a track originally written by Finneas for his band but later reworked to showcase Eilish`s unique voice. The song, uploaded to SoundCloud for a dance project, quickly gained traction, earning hundreds of thousands of listens within weeks. This attention caught the interest of Finneas’s manager, Danny Rukasin, who saw Eilish’s potential. \n\n By early 2016, Eilish signed with Apple Music’s Platoon, which helps emerging artists build their presence. With the release of the “Ocean Eyes” music video in March 2016, Eilish began gaining wider recognition. She followed up with her second single, "Six Feet Under," later that year. In August 2016, Justin Lubliner signed Eilish to Darkroom and Interscope Records, guiding her career with a focus on building a distinct persona and aesthetic rather than relying on one hit single. Darkroom re-released "Ocean Eyes" and "Six Feet Under," further solidifying her growing fanbase. \n\n In 2017, Eilish`s momentum surged with a series of singles, including "Bellyache," "Bored" (featured on Netflix`s 13 Reasons Why soundtrack), "Watch," and "Copycat." She also released her debut EP, Don’t Smile at Me, on August 11, 2017. The EP became a sleeper hit, peaking at number 14 on the US Billboard 200. To promote her music, Eilish embarked on the Don’t Smile at Me Tour in October 2017 and received extensive support from Spotify, including placement on its top playlists. \n\n Eilish’s success was amplified by her partnership with Apple Music, which named her their "Up Next" artist in September 2017. This recognition included a documentary, a live session EP, and an interview with Zane Lowe. Her experimental sound, blending melancholy pop with hip-hop influences, drew comparisons to Lana Del Rey and resonated with a growing audience. By the year’s end, Eilish released "&Burn," a remix of "Watch" featuring rapper Vince Staples, further showcasing her versatility and cementing her status as a rising star.'

      title: 'Going on Tour',
      content: 'Billie Eilish`s career from 2018 to 2024 was marked by a series of successful tours and notable musical releases. In early 2018, Eilish embarked on her Where`s My Mind Tour, during which she re-released the single “Bitches Broken Hearts” and collaborated with Khalid on the song "Lovely," which was featured in the 13 Reasons Why soundtrack. Additional releases during this period included "You Should See Me in a Crown" and a Record Store Day vinyl featuring "Party Favor" and a cover of Drake’s "Hotline Bling." The summer of 2018 saw Eilish performing at festivals like Mo Pop, further establishing her growing presence in the music industry. \n\n In 2019, Eilish released her debut album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?, which debuted at number one on multiple charts and broke numerous records. The album spawned several hit singles, including "Bury a Friend," "Wish You Were Gay," and "Bad Guy," the latter of which became her first number-one single in the U.S., dethroning Lil Nas X’s "Old Town Road." Eilish embarked on the When We All Fall Asleep Tour, starting with a performance at Coachella and concluding later that year in Mexico City. A follow-up Where Do We Go? World Tour was cut short in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, though she continued to release music, including “Everything I Wanted” and the James Bond theme "No Time to Die," which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song. \n\n Eilish`s sophomore album, Happier Than Ever, released in July 2021, included hits like "My Future," "Therefore I Am," and the title track. She promoted the album through an immersive Disney+ concert film and the Happier Than Ever, The World Tour, which spanned from 2022 to 2023. The tour included notable performances at Glastonbury and Coachella, where she became the youngest headliner to date. Mid-tour, she released the EP Guitar Songs, featuring the tracks "TV" and "The 30th," both of which were praised for their emotional immediacy and socially relevant lyrics. \n\n In 2023, Eilish made her acting debut in the series Swarm and contributed the song "What Was I Made For?" to the Barbie movie soundtrack. The track went on to win both an Academy Award and multiple Grammy Awards, solidifying her reputation as a multifaceted artist. In 2024, Eilish released her third studio album, Hit Me Hard and Soft, accompanied by a worldwide tour. Her continued evolution as a musician and performer, coupled with her ability to connect deeply with her audience, underscores her standing as one of the most influential artists of her generation.'

      title: 'Artistry Style and Inspiration',
      content: 'Billie Eilish is recognized for her distinctive soprano vocal range, described as "ethereal" by Noisey’s Avery Stone and "whispery" by Rolling Stone’s Maura Johnston. Her voice, which Doreen St. Félix of The New Yorker characterizes as "husky" and "slurring," shifts seamlessly into a thinner, reedy tone when needed. Music critic Robert Christgau highlighted her unique blend of musicality and pop sensibilities, noting her "diminutive" voice defies traditional vocal techniques while her "playful teen-goth angst" and "electro-saturated" debut album resonate with a wide audience. Her work spans an array of genres, including dark pop, electropop, emo pop, indie pop, and alt-pop, often exploring themes of depression. \n\n Eilish collaborates closely with her brother, Finneas, who writes and produces her music while also performing with her on stage. Together, they craft both deeply personal and fictional narratives, aiming for lyrics that feel conversational and layered. Eilish values storytelling that delivers profound messages in understated ways. Finneas tailors his writing to suit her voice and perspective, ensuring each song reflects her experiences and artistic vision. Their creative partnership underpins the emotional depth and relatability of her music. \n\n A long-time admirer of visual storytelling, Eilish made her directorial debut in 2019 with the music video for "Xanny," fulfilling an ambition she had since the age of 14. Her approach to her music videos mirrors her commitment to creating art that feels authentic and uniquely her own, further reinforcing her connection to her audience. \n\n Eilish’s influences are as diverse as her sound. Growing up, she listened to artists like The Beatles, Justin Bieber, Green Day, Arctic Monkeys, and Lana Del Rey, while Aurora’s song "Runaway" inspired her to pursue music. She cites hip-hop as her favorite genre and draws inspiration from Tyler, the Creator, Childish Gambino, Avril Lavigne, and Matty Healy of The 1975, whose concert she credits with shaping her artistry. Other notable influences include Adele, Amy Winehouse, Rihanna, and Damon Albarn, whose work has reshaped how she approaches music and creativity. \n\n Frequently compared to artists like Avril Lavigne, Lorde, and Lana Del Rey, Eilish strives to carve her own path, emphasizing her unique blend of styles and perspectives. She has also drawn inspiration from contemporary albums like Ariana Grande’s Thank U, Next, which motivated her to continue making music. With her genre-blurring style, compelling storytelling, and innovative artistry, Eilish continues to redefine what it means to be a pop artist today.'

She has used her platform to promote sustainable practices, hosting initiatives like the six-day climate seminar Overheated in London, which covered topics such as sustainable fashion and youth activism. Through her music, she has highlighted environmental issues, as seen in her 2019 single "All the Good Girls Go to Hell," which critiques inaction on climate change using vivid imagery of rising sea levels. Eilish has also collaborated with organizations like CoralWatch, allowing them to use her song "Ocean Eyes" for campaigns focused on the Great Barrier Reef. A proponent of reducing environmental impact, she avoids private jet travel and has partnered with REVERB`s Music Decarbonization Project, incorporating solar-powered stage lights into her performances. \n\n Eilish’s advocacy extends to animal rights and veganism. She consistently speaks out against industries that harm animals, such as the dairy, wool, and fur trades. Her commitment to ethical and sustainable choices is reflected not only in her public statements but also in her personal lifestyle, which emphasizes cruelty-free and vegan principles. She uses her influence to encourage fans to consider similar changes in their lives, leveraging her social media presence to amplify these causes. \n\n Women’s rights have also been central to Eilish’s activism. She has addressed body shaming and double standards through projects like her 2020 short film Not My Responsibility, which challenges societal pressures on women’s appearances. In her music, she tackles sensitive topics, such as the exploitation of young women in her 2021 song "Your Power." Eilish has been vocal about abortion rights, condemning restrictive laws and the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Her protest against these injustices has been evident in her performances, as well as her lyrics, which reflect her frustration with gender-based inequalities. \n\n Eilish is also politically active, encouraging her fans to vote and endorsing candidates who align with her views. She supported Joe Biden’s campaign during the 2020 U.S. presidential election and performed at the Democratic National Convention. In 2024, she endorsed the Harris-Walz ticket and called for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict by wearing an Artists4Ceasefire pin at the Academy Awards. Through her actions and influence, Eilish continues to champion causes that promote equity, sustainability, and social justice.'
